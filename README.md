# Pac-Man-NEAT
machine learning Pac-Man using the NEAT algorithm
Pac-Man first learned to navigate the maze and collect as many cookies as he can, then I introduced the ghosts

# What I learned
- How the Pac-Man game works, and how to code it
- Implementation of an advanced genetic algorithm using genes and cross-breeding
- Saving and loading machine learning model
